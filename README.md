# STUDENT MANAGE v1.0
This is the source code of one of my first programs written in C.

### Download

Just download and execute the .exe file in the [releases](https://github.com/mantecados/student-manage/releases/tag/v1.0.0) page


### How does it work?

1. [ADD STUDENTS] Adds an amount of students with an amount of grades both determined by the user and then calculates the average grade. (This function overwrites any information written before)
2. [PRINT STUDENTS]Prints the added students with their corresponding grades.
3. [EXIT] Exits lololol (and frees dynamically allocated memory)
